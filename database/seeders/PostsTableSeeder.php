Today we\'re pleased to share that Forge now supports dark mode, which can be toggled between light, dark, or automatically switch between modes depending on your operating system settings. We\'re releasing dark mode as a beta feature and will continue to improve it based on your feedback! If you donâ€™t have a Forge account, now is a great time to sign up! Forge allows you to painlessly create and manage PHP servers which include MySQL, Redis, Memcached, database backups, and everything else you need to run robust, modern Laravel applications.'

For that, we\'re launching another new package: Volt. Volt is an elegantly crafted functional API for Livewire, allowing component\'s PHP logic and Blade templates to coexist in the same file. Behind the scenes, the functional API is compiled to Livewire class components and linked with the template present in the same file.'
